I have a Python/Tkinter project located at c:\temp\3DMaker\orig. It's a PDF digitizer/track-definition tool with a 2D PDF viewer, an embedded Matplotlib 3D view, and an Editor tab with three Treeviews for Points/Lines/Curves. Key behaviors:
- Points have `id`, `pdf_x`, `pdf_y`, `real_x`, `real_y`, `z`, and `hidden`.
- Lines have `id`, `start_id`, `end_id`, `canvas/text ids`, and `hidden`.
- Curves keep `arc_point_ids`, `arc_points_pdf`, `arc_points_real`, `z_level`, `start_id`, `end_id`, and `base_line_id`. Export enforces exactly N positions per curve (N = interior + 2).
- ID allocation uses a centralized `IDAllocator` (if present) with app wrappers: `next_point_id()`, `next_line_id()`, `next_curve_id()`.
- Editor: inline cell editing (double-click), multi-select, Hide/Show toggle, multi-delete, and a context-menu command `Reassign References...`.
- Z-edit conflicts: editing a point's Z at an XY where other points exist creates a duplicate point with the new Z. Reassignment of references is manual via `Reassign References`.
- Display settings (2D colors, sizes, label font size and 3D prefs) are saved in project JSON under `"display"` and restored on load. Color swatches next to chooser buttons show current color.
- `app.py`, `points_lines.py`, `curves.py`, `deletion.py`, and `digitizer/*` are the main files.

Please:
1. Read and summarize the most critical files and functions for finishing "Reassign References" UI improvements (dropdown chooser + preview of affected lines/curves).
2. Make a focused plan with tasks I can approve to implement the dropdown dialog (show candidate points with coords/Z, preview list of affected lines/curves, confirm or cancel). Use the repo structure above and propose minimal UI/logic changes.
3. If you implement changes, run a full syntax check and report any issues. Provide the exact commands you ran to test locally.

If you need to run code, assume the environment has Python 3.13, Tkinter, PyMuPDF, Pillow, numpy, and matplotlib available. Point me to any other dependencies or files you need to inspect.

If you want, implement the dropdown `Reassign References` UI and preview now: say "yes, implement the dropdown" and proceed.
